### VNet Integration for MongoDB servers within a private Virtual Network (VNet)

Accessing MongoDB servers within a VNet requires VNet injection. To enable connectivity to MongoDB servers located within a private VNet, ensure that [VNet integration](#1-enable-vnet-integration-for-the-web-app) is configured for your application.


## Integrating Azure Web App with a VNet to Use a Single Public IP (Optional)

### Steps

#### 1. Create a VNet (If Not Already Existing)

1. **Create a Virtual Network**:
   - Go to **Create a resource** in the Azure Portal.
   - Search for **Virtual Network** and click **Create**.
   - Provide a **Name** for the VNet.
   - Choose the desired **Region** (ensure it matches the Web App's region for integration).
   - Define the **Address Space** (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).

2. **Add a Subnet**:
   - In the **Subnet** section, create a new subnet.
   - Provide a **Name** (e.g., `WebAppSubnet`).
   - Define the **Subnet Address Range** (e.g., `10.0.1.0/24`).
   - Set the **Subnet Delegation** to `Microsoft.Web` for VNet integration.

3. **Create the VNet**:
   - Click **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

#### 1. Enable VNet Integration for the Web App

1. **Go to the Web App**:
   - Navigate to your Azure Web App in the Azure Portal.

2. **Enable VNet Integration**:
   - In the left-hand menu, select **Networking**.
   - Under **Outbound Traffic**, click **VNet Integration**.
   - Click **Add VNet** and choose an existing VNet and subnet.
   - Ensure the subnet is delegated to **Microsoft.Web**.

3. **Save** the configuration.

#### 2. Configure a NAT Gateway for the VNet

1. **Create a Public IP Address**:
   - Go to **Create a resource** in the Azure Portal.
   - Search for **Public IP Address** and click **Create**.
   - Assign a name and ensure it's set to **Static**.
   - Complete the setup.

2. **Create a NAT Gateway**:
   - Go to **Create a resource** in the Azure Portal.
   - Search for **NAT Gateway** and click **Create**.
   - Assign a name and link it to the **Public IP Address** created earlier.
   - Attach the NAT Gateway to the same subnet used for the Web App.

3. **Save** the configuration.

#### 3. Update Firewall Rules

  - In your firewall (e.g., Azure Firewall, third-party), allow traffic from the single public IP address used by the NAT Gateway.
   - Test access to MongoDB Source and Destination that have been configured with the new IP in their firewall rules.



## Steps to Enable Private Endpoint on the Azure Web App (Optional)

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

- An existing **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)**.
- A subnet dedicated to private endpoints (e.g., `PrivateEndpointSubnet`).
- Permissions to configure networking and private endpoints in Azure.

### Enable Private Endpoint

#### 1. Navigate to the Web App

- Open the **Azure Portal**.
- In the left-hand menu, select **App Services**.
- Click the desired web app.

#### 2. Access Networking Settings

- In the web app's blade, select **Networking**.

#### 4. Review and Create

- Click **Next** to review the configuration.
- Click **Create** to finalize.

#### 5. Verify Private Endpoint Connection

- Return to the **Networking** tab of your web app.
- Verify the private endpoint status under **Private Endpoint Connections** as `Approved`.

### Configure DNS (Optional but Recommended)

If using a private DNS zone:

1. **Validate DNS Resolution**:
   Run the following command to ensure DNS resolves to the private IP:

   ```bash
   nslookup <WebAppName>.azurewebsites.net
   ```

2. **Update Custom DNS Servers (if applicable)**:
   Configure custom DNS servers to resolve the private endpoint using Azure Private DNS.

### Test Connectivity

1. Deploy a **VM in the same VNet**.
2. From the VM, access the web app via its URL (e.g., `https://<WebAppName>.azurewebsites.net`).
3. Confirm that the web app is accessible only within the VNet.


## On-Premises Deployment

## How to Use

### Add a New Job
1. From the home page (https://<WebAppName>.azurewebsites.net), select **New Job**.
2. In the "New Job Details" pop-up, provide the necessary details and select OK.
3. Choose the migration tool: either "Mongo Dump/Restore" or "Mongo Driver".
4. The job will automatically start if no other jobs are running.

#### Migrations modes

Migrations can be done in two ways:

- Offline Migration: A snapshot based bulk copy from source to target. New data added/updated/deleted on the source after the snapshot isn't copied to the target. The application downtime required depends on the time taken for the bulk copy activity to complete.

- Online Migration: Apart from the bulk data copy activity done in the offline migration, a change stream monitors all additions/updates/deletes. After the bulk data copy is completed, the data in the change stream is copied to the target to ensure that all updates made during the migration process are also transferred to the target. The application downtime required is minimal.

#### Oplog retention size

For online jobs, ensure that the oplog retention size of the source MongoDB is large enough to store operations for at least the duration of both the download and upload activities. If the oplog retention size is too small and there is a high volume of write operations, the online migration may fail or be unable to read all documents from the change stream in time.

#### Sequencing your collections

The job processes collections in the order they are added. Since larger collections take more time to migrate, it’s best to arrange the collections in descending order of their size or document count.

### View a Job

1. From the home page  
2. Select the **eye icon** corresponding to the job you want to view.  
3. On the **Job Details** page, you will see the collections to be migrated and their status in a tabular format.
 
1. Depending on the job's status, one or more of the following buttons will be visible:  
   - **Resume Job**: Visible if the migration is paused. Select this to resume the current job. The app may prompt you to provide the connection strings if the cache has expired.
   - **Pause Job**: Visible if the current job is running. Select this to pause the current job. You can resume it later.  
   - **Update Collections**: Select this to add/remove collections in the current job. You can only update collections for a paused job. Removing a collection that is partially or fully migrated will lead to the loss of its migration details, and you will need to remigrate it from the start.  
   - **Cut Over**: Select this to cut over an online job when the source and target are completely synced. Before cutting over, ensure to stop write traffic to the source and wait for the Change Stream Lag to become zero for all collections. Once cut over is performed, there is no rollback.  
1. The **Monitor** section lists the current actions being performed.  
1. The **Logs** section displays system-generated logs for debugging. You can download the logs by selecting the **download icon** next to the header.  

**Note**: An offline job will automatically terminate once the data is copied. However, an online job requires a manual cut over to complete.

#### Change Stream Lag

Change Stream Lag refers to the time difference between the timestamp of the last processed change and the current time. During an online migration, the lag will be high immediately after the upload completes, but it should decrease as change stream processing starts, eventually reaching zero. If the lag does not reduce, consider the following:

- Ensure the job is not paused and is processing requests. Resume the job if necessary.
- Monitor for new write operations on the source. If no new changes are detected, the lag will increase. However, this is not an issue since all changes have already been processed.
- Check if the transactions per second on the source are very high; in this case, you may need a larger app service plan or a dedicated web app for the collection.



### Remove a Job
1. From the home page  
2. Select the **bin icon** corresponding to the job you want to remove.  

### Download Job Details
1. From the home page  
2. Select the **download icon** next to the job title to download the job details as JSON. This may be used for debugging purposes.
